    "overview": "The Apps Pod is responsible for building the foundation of Dia's app ecosystem and making those apps discoverable and useful in users' daily workflows. This includes developing the core infrastructure that allows apps to integrate deeply with browser context, establishing patterns for how apps are invoked and interact with user data, and creating the systems that help users discover and engage with apps at the right moments. To achieve these objectives, the pod is currently focused on two core workstreams: comprehensive meeting support across the entire meeting lifecycle, and proactive app suggestions that surface relevant tools based on contextual signals. The pod balances technical platform work—like app APIs, permission models, and context-sharing systems—with user-facing features that make apps feel native to the browser experience. Success means apps become an essential part of how users work in Dia, seamlessly bridging their tasks across tools and workflows.",
    "meetingsWorkstream": "This workstream is building comprehensive meeting support capabilities that span the entire meeting lifecycle. The focus is on helping users prepare effectively before meetings by surfacing relevant context from past conversations, documents, and related work; enabling seamless participation during meetings with integrated note-taking and real-time context; and facilitating thorough follow-up by capturing action items, decisions, and next steps. The system integrates deeply with calendar systems to understand meeting context and relationships, automatically surfaces relevant materials and previous meeting notes, and creates persistent records that connect to broader work streams. The goal is to make meetings feel less like isolated events and more like connected moments in ongoing work, where all the necessary context is available without manual searching or preparation.",
    "proactiveSuggestionsWorkstream": "This workstream is developing the foundational system that enables Dia to intelligently suggest relevant browser apps and actions based on contextual signals from the user's workflow. Rather than requiring users to explicitly invoke apps or remember which tools are available, the system analyzes current context—including the content they're viewing, the task they're performing, their recent activity patterns, and environmental signals—to proactively surface tools that would be valuable at that moment. The core challenge is building triggering logic that can reliably identify these moments of need from available signals while maintaining appropriate confidence thresholds to ensure suggestions feel helpful rather than intrusive or distracting. The team is establishing evaluation frameworks for measuring contextual appropriateness, designing prompts that can accurately assess user intent, and defining the UX patterns for how AI-driven suggestions integrate into the browser experience without disrupting flow. This includes determining when to show suggestions inline versus in ambient locations, how to balance frequency with utility, and how users can provide feedback to improve future suggestions. The workstream establishes patterns that will scale across future Dia features, creating a foundation for anticipatory, context-aware browser experiences that make the right tools available at the right moments."

    "workMethodology": "We work in named, ~6‑week milestones with a dedicated planning week up front; pods publish lightweight plans in Notion that set outcome‑based goals, success measures, risks, owners, and schedules, and align to company strategy. During execution, teams run three two‑week sprints with weekly reassessment, track projects in Linear as the source of truth with burndowns and status signals, and keep cross‑functional partners aligned via Milestone Planning hubs and kickoff pages. We cut weekly releases, and before high‑stakes dates we tighten quality bars with \"pencils down,\" stricter PR review, and risk assessments. Company milestone dates are also mirrored on the shared calendar so everyone can plan around \"week x\" markers. Examples of this flow are visible across Espresso plans (Browser, Services, DevEx, Enterprise) and related updates in Slack."

  "contextForAI": "This page includes detailed information about the user that you are working with. They are coming to you with questions and conversations as if you are their coworker. To better equip you, this page includes the relevant context and information that you need to know that a coworker would know about the user. It starts with specific information about the exact project the user wants help with, and then continues with more general and high level information about the user, the company, and other relevant work context. When responding to the user, always assume that they are asking questions specifically about the context of either this exact project or their work more broadly.\n\nAPPS POD: ESPRESSO MILESTONE\n\nThe Apps Pod is responsible for building the foundation of Dia's app ecosystem and making those apps discoverable and useful in users' daily workflows.
