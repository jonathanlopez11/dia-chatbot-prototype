<aside>

Over the next twelve months, our work will span four focus areas to achieve our goal of
**one million weekly active users** by October 2026.

We will do this by making Dia…

1. the best traditional **Browser** on the market
2. the best AI **Chat** tool for knowledge work
3. the best place to use the most popular work **Apps**
4. the browser **Enterprise** IT and security teams green-light over competing AI browsers
</aside>

The purpose of this document is to outline the P0 and P1 goals for each of these focus areas in the Espresso milestone, informing each team’s planning.

# **Browser**

We need to differentiate Dia more dramatically. But we can’t do that if people are churning for trivial reasons that prevent them from replacing their default browser with Dia. And we certainly can’t do it if the browser part of Dia is effectively undifferentiated from Chrome — other than being more minimal and beautiful. All of this work is in service of growth, and of our goal: one million weekly active users.

Here are our P0 and P1 goals for the Espresso milestone:

- **P0**: Ship one to three things each week related to either (a) the top reasons for churn — protecting the bottom of our growth funnel — or (b) a “greatest hit” Arc feature adapted for Dia, which we know will be beloved and believe can help court former Arc members. Across these two buckets, prioritize the projects we think will most impact growth, engagement, or retention — either through high frequency of use or highly differentiated value. Performance wins, top crash fixes, and similar efforts should be considered part of this bucket.
- **P1**: Offer the best tab management feature on the market for work projects. *“Chrome has Tab Groups, Arc had Spaces, and Dia offers ____ — the best tab management feature for people whose daily work is reflected in open browser tabs.”* By the end of the milestone, we should have de-risked enough directions to be confident in the best-in-class solution (even if not yet production-ready). This is a bet on work-related differentiation relative to competitors, and on the belief that any successful implementation here will serve as at least a partial replacement for Arc Spaces. We expect both to be short-term drivers of growth.

**How will we know if we’re successful at the end of Espresso?**

- **P0**: We should also be able to send a resurrection email to everyone who churned from Dia since June 11 — with a list of the things we’ve shipped since then that may have previously caused frustration.
- **P1**: We should be able to send an email to all Arc members with a pitch for why Dia’s project (tab) management feature is at least a partial replacement for Arc Spaces — and even more powerful for new use cases.

**What are the key open questions for planning week?**

- **P0**: What is our formula for deciding which projects to prioritize — across churn reasons, performance and stability issues, Arc’s greatest hits, and more?
- **P1**: How do we stack rank the sub-goals within this hypothesis — e.g. this feature as an Arc Spaces replacement versus a differentiated AI context feature?

# **Chat**

Just like our browser work, the AI chat experience in Dia must be both substitutive — for ChatGPT — and sufficiently differentiated. Our North Star here, since we can’t match parity on everything, is to focus on making “the most dependable AI chat tool for knowledge work.” The bet is that we can convince individuals to treat Dia as the work version of ChatGPT. In other words, make Dia to ChatGPT what Notion is to Apple Notes: the pro AI chat tool. In this sense, we compete more with Anthropic than OpenAI over time.

Here are our P0 and P1 goals for the Espresso milestone:

- **P0**: Improve the quality and reliability of Chat — from latency to tool use dependability. If you can’t rely on Dia Chat to respond consistently with a high level of quality, it can’t be trusted for work.
- **P1**: Follow through on what we learn from our Skills launch. In simple terms: squash the most prominent bugs, address the most common usability feedback, and make principled progress on response quality.

**How will we know if we’re successful at the end of Espresso?**

- **P0**: We should see significant gains in key AI quality and reliability metrics — and reductions in reported issues.
- **P1**: We should have a sharp understanding of what’s most holding Skills back from widespread usage, and as a result of our work, Skills retention and engagement metrics should meaningfully increase.

**What are the key open questions for planning week?**

- **P0**: How do we determine the impact and prioritization of quality and reliability projects? It’s likely a formula that considers product and technical risk, the percentage of members impacted per week, staffing and timeline requirements, and more? What exact criteria should we use to assess quality and reliability (i.e. metrics, evals, etc)?
- **P1**: What is the most impactful work in cycle one, before a critical mass of feedback has arrived? Our instinct is to make our first-party Skills (a) more differentiated and (b) more discoverable within existing web app workflows.

# **Apps**

If *Browser* is our foundation and *Chat* keeps us in the conversation, *Apps* are how we win. The web apps you use most in your default desktop browser are usually the ones most central to your job. We also know browser tabs — and the apps within them — better than OpenAI, Anthropic, or Perplexity. “AI that makes your apps better” — in a consistent, compounding way across them all — is fresh and strategic too.

*Dia is the best browser for [app name]* is a differentiated claim in the AI market and pro-Web and pro-app developers, in a way that our competitors are not (and hope to replace). Our work here can also make Apps the primary place where Skills are most upsold and most differentiated — for example, Skills that auto-intercept common workflows across GitHub, Linear, and other developer tools.

Here are our P0 and P1 goals for the Espresso milestone:

- **P0**: Break out the most important parts of app objects — videos, video calls, PRs, and more — and bring them directly to you, right when you need them. Start with Arc’s Meeting PIP and Meeting Reminder.
- **P1**: Use Dia’s awareness of your tabs — and the objects within them, and the relationships between them — to proactively offer to do work on your behalf, [starting with Rishi’s proposed prototype](https://www.notion.so/Dia-The-Operating-System-for-Work-2806125036768089b20cdf0c850a7757?pvs=21).

**How will we know if we’re successful at the end of Espresso?**

- **P0**: More than 33% of Dia WAUs should interact with one of these features each week – e.g. Meeting PIP activated automatically.
- **P1**: The majority of our team should be using at least one proactive suggestion every day, or meeting a similar internal engagement goal.

**What are the key open questions for planning week?**

- **P0**: What’s our framework and definition of value for these integrations — e.g. is it them appearing, users engaging with them; or a variation depending on the type of interaction? What defines an ideal integration — e.g. number of WAUs it could auto-intercept weekly, ability to build without auth — and what are the first few after the two meeting-related features from Arc? How do we collaborate with the Chat pod?
- **P1**: How do we ensure overwhelming utility and consistent responses — e.g. a process for prototyping widely (to de-risk value) and then dialing in quality? What’s our success metric?

# **Enterprise**

To maintain our independence and increase our annual budget next year, we must make Dia ready to be sold to enterprises — bundled with Atlassian’s Teamwork Collection. This requires careful choreography across a wide range of demands (and stakeholders): Enterprise IT, browser security, AI security, Atlassian internal integrations, member-facing product features, and more. Sequencing matters over the next twelve months — as does not losing sight of the fact that if we don’t hit one million WAUs, Enterprise won’t matter at all.

Here are our P0 and P1 goals for the Espresso milestone:

- **P0**: Get Dia approved to turn on for 500+ Atlassian employees (by working closely with their IT and security teams).
- **P1**: Create a (rough) twelve month roadmap, working backward from where we need to be this time next year.

**How will we know if we’re successful at the end of Espresso?**

- **P0**: We have posted in the internal Arc channel at Atlassian, offering any employees in it the chance to onboard to Dia if they wish.
- **P1**: Josh has sent Mike an email with our proposed roadmap and key asks for how Atlassian resources can help accelerate it.

**What are the key open questions for planning week?**

- **P0**: How do we draw the line between “absolute must” and “nice to have” — and negotiate with Atlassian in this grey area?
- **P1**: What sequencing best optimizes for bottoms-up WAU growth, such as prioritizing security value props that appeal to individuals first?
